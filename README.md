## Mixins 
It's a file for SCSS/SASS mixins. You can use mixins for media queries or when you need to write the same code over and over again. For instance, in the file, you can see @mixin absCenter. Instead of writing that four lines inside of it on your own, you can just write @include absCenter; in your other scss files.
